# Description

oddiff is a simple tool that wraps the native od command against both files passed in, and then applies a colorized diff output between the two results of od.

# Results

When the two files are identical, you will see the octal representation of the file printed in a grey text to the console.
If there are any differences they will be displayed in-line in the console output with red (removed) and green (added) to the screen.
